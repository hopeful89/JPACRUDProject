### Lessons learned

Attention to detail of passing the data around from java out to the jsp in expression language.  The ease of having spring annotations has completely changed the way we do things.  I really really really liked have all the transactions handle by @Transactional and letting @PersistenceContext take care of my connections with the database.  The managed entity is really nice though I need to learn more on the update side of things.  I am getting much more comfortable working from examples and piecing the code together.  What is the code doing or not doing? What should it be doing? Questions I find myself asking a lot.  Also, Object Relational Mapping with JPA entities is great.
